## Introduction:

Accurately predicting house prices is crucial for both buyers and sellers in the real estate market. This project utilizes the Linear Regression Algorithm to forecast house prices based on key features such as property size, location, and other critical attributes. By analyzing these factors, the model helps stakeholders make data-driven decisions and understand the variables influencing property values.

## Project Overview:

The **House Price Prediction** project aims to predict the selling price of houses based on various features using the **Linear Regression Algorithm**. This analysis helps property investors, sellers, and buyers to accurately estimate house prices and make informed decisions.

---

## Problem Statement:

A key challenge for property sellers is determining the sale price of a property. The ability to predict the exact property value is beneficial for property investors as well as buyers to plan their finances according to the price trend. The property prices depend on several features like:

- Property area
- Basement square footage
- Year built
- Number of bedrooms
- Road access type

By using **Linear Regression**, we aim to build a model that can accurately predict house prices based on these factors.
